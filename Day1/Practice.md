# JavaScript Practice Questions Day 1

## ðŸŸ¢ Basic (1â€“20)

1. Declare a variable `x` with value 10. Multiply it by 2 and log the result.
2. Swap values of two variables `a = 5`, `b = 7` using a third variable.
3. Find the remainder when 17 is divided by 5.
4. Given `let name = "John"`, display "Hello John" using string concatenation.
5. Check if a number is even or odd (using `%` and `if`).
6. Write a program to compare two numbers and print the greater one.
7. Convert a string `"25"` to a number and add 5.
8. Use `typeof` to log the type of variables: `42`, `"Hi"`, `true`, `null`.
9. Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
10. Write a program to find the maximum of three numbers using `if-else`.
11. Write a program that prints "Pass" if marks are above 40, else "Fail".
12. Given `let x = 3`, use `x++` and `++x` and log the output.
13. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a `for` loop.
14. Write a `while` loop to print numbers from 5 to 1.
15. Write a `do...while` loop to print "Hi" 3 times.
16. Find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop.
17. Print all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a `for` loop.
18. Use a loop to count the number of digits in a given number.
19. Print the multiplication table of 5 up to 10.
20. Check whether a given year is a leap year.

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (21â€“40)

21. Reverse a given number (e.g., 123 â†’ 321).
22. Count the number of vowels in a string.
23. Use a `for` loop to calculate the factorial of a number.
24. Print all numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3 and 5.
25. Print the Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms.
26. Check whether a number is a prime number.
27. Print a triangle of stars (`*`) using nested `for` loops (5 rows).
28. Find the largest digit in a number.
29. Use a loop to find the sum of digits of a number.
30. Given a number, check if it is a palindrome (e.g., 121 â†’ true).
31. Given `let x = 10`, use a loop and `break` when `x == 5`.
32. Use `break` to stop a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 100 at 25.
33. Given an array `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, find the first even number > 5 and break.
34. Write a program to print the first 5 even numbers using `while` and `break`.
35. Generate a random number between 1 to 10. Break the loop when it is 7.
36. Loop through numbers 1â€“10, but break if the number is divisible by 4 and 6.
37. Use a `for` loop with `break` to find the first number > 100 that's divisible by both 3 and 7.
38. Use nested loops to print coordinates (i, j) for i=1â€“3 and j=1â€“3, but break when `i * j == 4`.
39. Create a guessing game: user guesses a number until correct (use `prompt()` and `break`).
40. Write a loop that continuously takes input until the user types "exit".

## ðŸ”´ Brainstorming (41â€“50)

41. Print the first 10 prime numbers using `for` and `break`.
42. From 1 to 50, find the first 5 numbers divisible by both 4 and 6.
43. Use a `while` loop to keep doubling a number until it's greater than 1000. Count the steps.
44. Write a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 100 but breaks if a number is a perfect square.
45. Find the first character in a string that repeats and break the loop once found.
46. Write a loop to find the smallest number in an array without using `Math.min()` â€” use `break` if the array has a negative number.
47. Print a number pyramid like this:
    ```
    1
    1 2
    1 2 3
    ...
    ```
    Stop the loop if the number exceeds 10.
48. Sum the digits of a number until a single-digit is obtained (use nested loop and `break`).
49. Write a loop to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers.
50. Loop through a string and stop at the first uppercase letter using `break`.
